# Project_nepal_Earth_Quake_Damage_using_OHE_-_Decision_Tree_Classifier

Project Overview:- As part of my data science endeavors, I embarked on a comprehensive project centered around assessing air quality in Nairobi, Kenya. Utilizing MongoDB as the database, I employed various time series models, including Linear Regression, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Autoregressive (AR) models, to detect PM2.5 readings and gain valuable insights into the city's air pollution patterns.

Project Description:

Data Collection and MongoDB Integration: I collected extensive air quality data from multiple sources in Nairobi, such as government agencies and environmental monitoring stations. This data was stored and managed efficiently using MongoDB, facilitating easy access and retrieval for analysis.

Data Preprocessing and Exploration: To ensure data accuracy, I performed rigorous data preprocessing, handling missing values and outliers. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to visualize trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the PM2.5 readings.

Linear Regression Model: Implementing a Linear Regression model, I aimed to establish relationships between PM2.5 concentrations and relevant meteorological factors like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The model allowed for the identification of significant predictors affecting air quality.

Time Series Analysis: For capturing temporal dependencies and seasonal patterns, I employed Time Series models - ARIMA and AR. These models forecasted PM2.5 readings based on historical data, enabling short-term and long-term predictions.

Model Evaluation and Selection: I evaluated the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The best-performing model was selected to make reliable predictions and insights.

Air Quality Insights: Through data analysis and model predictions, I gained valuable insights into the trends and fluctuations in PM2.5 levels over time. These insights provided a deeper understanding of air pollution patterns in Nairobi, helping in the identification of critical areas and potential solutions for improving air quality.

Recommendations: Based on the project findings, I derived actionable recommendations for local authorities and policymakers to implement targeted measures for mitigating air pollution in Nairobi. These recommendations aimed to foster a healthier and sustainable living environment for the city's residents.

Conclusion: The Air Quality Analysis in Nairobi project exemplified my proficiency in data collection, management using MongoDB, and advanced time series modeling techniques. By leveraging these skills, I gained significant insights into air pollution dynamics, fostering data-driven solutions to address environmental challenges. The project demonstrates my commitment to utilizing data science for the betterment of society and the environment.
